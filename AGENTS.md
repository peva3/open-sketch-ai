# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini, ...) when working on this repository.

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file for Claude Code compatibility.

## Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Stable releases only. Do not commit directly.
- **`dev`**: Active development. All work here.

## Guidelines

- **NEVER bump version numbers** unless explicitly asked
- **NEVER commit changes** unless explicitly asked
- **NEVER read git-ignored files** unless explicitly asked
- **NEVER use emojis** in documentation
- **NEVER include `vcad/vendor/*` submodule pointer changes in regular commits** — use the `commit-vendor` skill instead. All vendored submodules track upstream `main` directly (no local patches); a pointer must be an upstream commit, otherwise the repo becomes uncloneable. Changes a vendored crate needs go upstream as a PR, never into a patch branch.
- **Use `git ls-tree -r HEAD`** to find project files
- **Use portable shebangs** - `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, etc.

## For AI Agents — Common Mistakes

```bash
# WRONG — git add includes vendor submodule pointer changes
git add -A && git commit -m "Add feature"

# CORRECT — exclude vendor, use commit-vendor skill for submodule changes
git add driver/ runtime/
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -v vcad/vendor/
```

```bash
# WRONG — debug build (SketchUp loads release binary)
cargo build --manifest-path vcad/sidecar/Cargo.toml

# CORRECT — always build release
cargo build --release --manifest-path vcad/sidecar/Cargo.toml
```

```bash
# WRONG — find/ls to discover project files (misses git-ignored state)
find . -name "*.rb"

# CORRECT — git ls-tree shows tracked files only
git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep '\.rb$'
```

## Architecture

MCP-based platform connecting AI agents to SketchUp:

- **Python MCP Driver** (`driver/`) - MCP Python SDK server (`MCPServer`) exposing tools to AI
- **Ruby Runtime** (`runtime/`) - SketchUp extension executing commands
- **Socket Communication** - TCP on localhost:9876 (default)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Launch SketchUp with extension
./scripts/launch-sketchup.sh

# CLI commands
./supex status
./supex info
./supex reload

# Run all tests
./test

# Run selected test suites (slugs: driver, stdlib, runtime, mock, sidecar, viewer, radar, e2e)
./test viewer sidecar
./test --list          # show available suites

# Rebuild binaries (slugs: sidecar, viewer)
./scripts/rebuild.sh                   # rebuild all
./scripts/rebuild.sh sidecar           # rebuild only sidecar

# Build production .rbz
cd runtime && bundle exec rake build

# Build the CI image locally and run the test suites in it (args go to launch-test.sh)
./scripts/docker-test.sh
./scripts/docker-test.sh sidecar viewer

# Release: bump every component version + lockfiles, commit, sign tag, fast-forward main
./scripts/release.sh 0.3.0
./scripts/release.sh --bump-only 0.3.0   # only rewrite files, preview with git diff
./scripts/changelog.sh v0.3.0            # write the GitHub Release changelog prompt to .tmp/
```

## Key Files

**Driver (Python):**
- `driver/src/supex_driver/mcp/mcp_server.py` - MCP server and tools
- `driver/src/supex_driver/mcp/vcad_tools.py` - VCAD MCP tools
- `driver/src/supex_driver/connection/sketchup_connection.py` - SketchUp socket connection
- `driver/src/supex_driver/connection/vcad_connection.py` - VCAD sidecar connection

- `driver/src/supex_driver/agent/` - Supex Chat Agent: config, providers (OpenAI/Anthropic), MCP client, file tools, agent loop, local HTTP server + chat UI, `supex-chat` CLI

**Runtime (Ruby):**
- `runtime/src/supex_runtime.rb` - Extension loader
- `runtime/src/supex_runtime/main.rb` - Main extension code

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/launch-sketchup.sh` - Development launcher
- `mcp` - MCP server entry point
- `supex` - CLI entry point
- `sketch` - supex-chat agent entry point (Unix convenience wrapper for `supex-chat`)

## Naming Conventions

- **VCAD** is an acronym — always write "VCAD" in prose (docs, comments, docstrings, log messages), never "vcad"
- Lowercase `vcad` is correct in identifiers (`vcad_place`, `vcad_connection`), file paths (`vcad/sidecar/`), logger names (`supex.vcad`), and Rust crate names (`vcad-eval`, `vcad-kernel`)
- For library source files, prefer `.oo` extension (not `.loon`) in docs, examples, and generated project conventions

## VCAD Sidecar

Rust binary at `vcad/sidecar/`. Dependencies (vcad, loon, tang) are vendored as git submodules in `vcad/vendor/` (tang provides autodiff used by vcad via relative path deps; phyz is not vendored — vcad pins it as a git dependency, fetched by Cargo on demand). After cloning, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` if you didn't use `--recurse-submodules`.

The vcad submodule requires `npm install` in `vcad/vendor/vcad/` for font assets used at compile time. This modifies the tracked `package-lock.json` — tell git to ignore the change:

```bash
cd vcad/vendor/vcad
npm install
git update-index --assume-unchanged package-lock.json Cargo.lock
# local-only ignore for node_modules and IDE files (not committed to vcad repo)
echo -e "node_modules/\n*.iml" >> $(git rev-parse --git-dir)/info/exclude
```

Also exclude IDE files in loon and tang:

```bash
for repo in loon tang; do
  echo "*.iml" >> $(git -C vcad/vendor/$repo rev-parse --git-dir)/info/exclude
done
```

During development, vendor submodules often show as dirty in `git status` (untracked build artifacts, modified files). Silence this noise in the parent repo:

```bash
git config submodule.vcad/vendor/vcad.ignore dirty
git config submodule.vcad/vendor/loon.ignore dirty
git config submodule.vcad/vendor/tang.ignore dirty
```

This only hides working-tree dirt — committed HEAD pointer changes still show up (which is what you want).

After a vendor roll (submodule update), Cargo may retain stale `.rmeta` cache because git doesn't always update file mtimes. This causes `cargo check` (and IDE diagnostics) to report false errors while `cargo build` succeeds. Fix by clearing the affected crates:

```bash
just clear-rust-caches
```

In IntelliJ IDEA, follow up with **Refresh Cargo Projects** in the Build tool window.

After any code change that affects the sidecar:

1. **Rebuild release binary** (SketchUp uses release, not debug):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rebuild.sh sidecar
   ```
2. **Restart the running sidecar** — kill the old process and relaunch:
   ```bash
   kill $(pgrep -f supex-vcad-sidecar)
   sleep 1
   SUPEX_WORKSPACE=$WORKSPACE scripts/launch-vcad-sidecar.sh &
   ```
   `$WORKSPACE` is the user's project directory (e.g. an `example-*` project).
3. **Verify** with `check_status` or `vcad_place`.

Temp directory is resolved as: `SUPEX_VCAD_TEMP_DIR` (explicit) > `SUPEX_WORKSPACE/.tmp/vcad-sidecar` (derived). If neither env var is set, the sidecar panics at startup.

## Observability with Radar

Radar (`devtools/radar/`) is a log aggregator that tails all supex subsystem logs in real-time. It normalizes events from MCP protocol, runtime console, CLI, and VCAD sidecar into a unified stream. Each event gets a deterministic 6-char hex EID (e.g. `a1b2c3`).

### Agent workflow

Run two radar instances during a session for full observability:

1. **Background stream** — plain text output for automated monitoring:
   ```bash
   ./radar watch --plain              # streams events to stdout
   ./radar watch --plain -l WARN      # only warnings and errors
   ./radar watch --plain -s mcp-protocol,vcad-sidecar
   ```

2. **Interactive pane** — TUI in a separate tmux pane for drill-down:
   ```bash
   ./radar watch                      # launches TUI
   ```
   Use `j`/`k` to browse events, `Enter` to open detail panel (shows full event with EID), `Tab` to toggle raw view, `/` to search.

Cross-reference events between the two: the `--plain` stream prints `[e:EID]` per line, and the TUI detail panel shows the same EID. Use this to find an event in the plain stream and inspect its full detail in the TUI (or vice versa).

### Filtering

```bash
./radar watch -l ERROR                  # minimum log level
./radar watch -s runtime-console        # specific source(s)
./radar watch -s mcp-protocol,vcad-sidecar -l WARN
```

Available sources: `mcp-protocol`, `mcp-stderr`, `cli-driver`, `cli-stdout`, `cli-stderr`, `runtime-console`, `runtime-stdout`, `runtime-stderr`, `vcad-sidecar`, `vcad-events`.

## Agent Prompts Convention

User projects symlink `docs/agents/guide/` as `supex-guide/` in their project root, so the guide is read from two locations. Therefore:

- Files in `docs/agents/guide/` reference each other and the symlinked `api/`, `stdlib/` and `cad-lib/` directories by bare relative paths (`ruby.md`, `stdlib/README.md`), which resolve both in this repository and through the `supex-guide/` symlink
- Do not use repository-relative paths (`docs/...`) inside the guide; anything outside `docs/agents/guide/` is not reachable from a user project
- The exception is `docs/agents/README.md` which uses repository-relative paths because it describes this repository's structure for human readers, not agent consumption
